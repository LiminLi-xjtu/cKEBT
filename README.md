This method provides a way to assess goodness of correction for batch effects of single-cell RNA-seq, and it specifically targets situations where the proportions of cell types in different batches is quite different.

Usage example: 
demo.R

Required data:
gene expression matrix (each row represents a cell with each column meaning one gene); batch labels; cell type labels
